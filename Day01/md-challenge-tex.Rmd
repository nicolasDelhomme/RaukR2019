# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Cars
The structure of the `car` dataset
```{r cars,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE}
str(cars)
```

The `head` of the dataset
```{r head}
head(cars)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=7, fig.cap="Car pressure by temperature"}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Session Info
```{r session info, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
